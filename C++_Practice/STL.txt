Introduction To STL :-
STL is used because it is as good idea not to reinvent the wheel.

Components Of STL :-
1. Containers :- -> Object which Stores Data.
                  -> Use Template Classes.
 Types Of Containers -> a. Sequence Containers. -> Stores data in linear fashion likewise Vector, List, Dequeue
             => Vector -> Random Access = Fast, Middle insertion/deletion = Slow, Deletion/Insertion at the end = Fast.

             => List -> Random Access = Slow, Middle insertion/deletion = Fast, Deletion/Insertion at the end = Fast.

                        b. Associative Containers. -> Direct Access like Tree, Set/Multiset, Map/Multimap.
                        => All operations are fast except random access.
                    
                        c. Derived Containers. -> Real world modelling like Stack, Queue, Priority-Queue.
                        => Depends on Data structure.

               
2. Algorithms :- -> Procedure to process data. 
                 -> Sorting.
                 -> Searching.
                 -> Use Template Functions.

3. Iterators :- -> Object points to an element in a container.
                -> Handled just like pointers.
                -> connects algo with containers.
